2. Open console (F12) and paste the script
3. Review the detection report

## ⚠️ Notes

- Mass blocking navigates between pages — this is expected
- Always use dry-run mode first to review the list
- Bot detection has false positives — review before blocking
- Unblocking from settings page is faster than individual visits
