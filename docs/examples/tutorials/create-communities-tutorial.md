# Create Communities — Tutorial

> Step-by-step guide to creating X Communities with name, description, rules, and privacy settings using XActions browser scripts.

**Works on:** Browser Console
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time:** 2-5 minutes
**Requirements:** Logged into x.com in your browser

---

## Prerequisites

- Logged into x.com in your browser
- Browser DevTools console (F12 -> Console tab)
- Navigate to `https://x.com/communities` before running

---

## Quick Start

1. Open x.com and navigate to **Communities** (`https://x.com/communities`)
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools, then click the **Console** tab
3. Copy the script from `src/createCommunity.js`
4. Edit the `CONFIG` section with your community details
5. Paste into the console and press Enter

---

## Configuration

```js
const CONFIG = {
  name: 'My XActions Community',
  description: 'A community for X automation enthusiasts. Built with XActions.',
  rules: [
    'Be respectful to all members',
    'No spam or self-promotion without value',
    'Stay on topic',
  ],
  isPrivate: false,              // true = approval required to join

  // Timing
  navigationDelay: 3000,
  actionDelay: 2000,
  typeCharDelay: 50,

  // Safety
  dryRun: true,
};
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | `'My XActions Community'` | Community display name |
| `description` | `string` | `'A community for...'` | Community description shown to visitors |
| `rules` | `string[]` | `[...]` | Array of community rules. Each string is one rule |
| `isPrivate` | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, users must be approved to join |
| `navigationDelay` | `number` | `3000` | Milliseconds to wait for page navigation |
| `actionDelay` | `number` | `2000` | Milliseconds between UI actions |
| `typeCharDelay` | `number` | `50` | Milliseconds between keystrokes |
| `dryRun` | `boolean` | `true` | Preview mode -- no community is actually created |

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Creating a Public Community

**Step 1 -- Configure your community**

```js
const CONFIG = {
  name: 'Web3 Builders Hub',
  description: 'A space for developers building decentralized applications. Share projects, get feedback, and collaborate.',
  rules: [
    'Be constructive and supportive',
    'Share your work -- show, do not just tell',
    'No shilling tokens or NFTs without context',
    'English only for now',
  ],
  isPrivate: false,
  dryRun: true,
};
```

**Step 2 -- Preview with dry run**

```
CREATE COMMUNITY
DRY RUN MODE -- set CONFIG.dryRun = false to actually create
Name: "Web3 Builders Hub"
Description: "A space for developers building decentralized..."
Rules: 4
Private: false
Navigating to Communities...
Opening community creation...
Setting community name...
Name set: "Web3 Builders Hub"
Setting description...
Description set
Adding community rules...
  Rule 1: "Be constructive and supportive"
  Rule 2: "Share your work -- show, do not just tell"
  Rule 3: "No shilling tokens or NFTs without context"
  Rule 4: "English only for now"
Creating community...
Community created!
```

**Step 3 -- Create for real**

Set `dryRun: false` and paste again.

### Creating a Private (Approval-Required) Community

Set `isPrivate: true` to require approval for new members:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  name: 'XActions Beta Testers',
  description: 'Private group for testing new XActions features before release.',
  rules: [
    'Report bugs with reproduction steps',
    'Do not share beta features publicly',
    'Be patient -- it is a beta!',
  ],
  isPrivate: true,
  dryRun: false,
};
```

When `isPrivate` is true, the script will toggle the privacy setting, requiring you to manually approve new members who request to join.

---

## Tips & Tricks

- **Keep rules clear and concise.** Each rule should be one sentence. Aim for 3-5 rules.
- **Write a compelling description.** This is what people see before joining. Explain what the community is about and who it is for.
- **Start public, go private later.** Public communities grow faster. You can always change to private after building an initial membership.
- **The script handles multi-step flows.** Some community creation dialogs have multiple screens (name -> description -> rules -> confirm). The script clicks "Next" between steps.
- **State is saved.** Progress is stored in `sessionStorage` under `xactions_createCommunity`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Could not find Create Community button" | Navigate to `x.com/communities` and look for the create option. It may be behind a menu |
| "Could not find name input" | The community creation UI may have changed. Try creating manually first to understand the current flow |
| Rules not being added | The rule input selectors may have changed. The script tries multiple fallback selectors |
| Privacy toggle not found | The privacy setting may be on a different screen. Check if there is a "Next" button to advance |
| Community creation fails silently | Check if there are any error banners on the page. X may have restrictions on community creation |
