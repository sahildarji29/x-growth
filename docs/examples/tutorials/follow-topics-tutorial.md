## Step-by-Step Guide

### Listing Your Followed Topics

**Step 1 -- Navigate to your topics**

Go to `https://x.com/settings/your_topics`.

**Step 2 -- Configure**

```js
const CONFIG = {
  action: 'list',
  dryRun: false,   // Safe -- only reads data
};
```

**Step 3 -- Run**

```
Listing followed topics...
  Cryptocurrency
  Artificial Intelligence
  JavaScript
  Web Development
  Machine Learning
Found 5 topics
```

### Following Topics by Keyword

**Step 1 -- Navigate to topic discovery**

Go to `https://x.com/i/topics/picker/home` or `https://x.com/i/topics`.

**Step 2 -- Configure**

```js
const CONFIG = {
  action: 'follow',
  keywords: ['blockchain', 'defi', 'ethereum', 'solana'],
  maxActions: 20,
  dryRun: true,
};
```

**Step 3 -- Preview and run**

The script scrolls through available topics and follows any whose name matches your keywords.

```
Following topics matching: [blockchain, defi, ethereum, solana]...
Following: "Blockchain"...
  Followed "Blockchain" (1/20)
Following: "DeFi"...
  Followed "DeFi" (2/20)
Following: "Ethereum"...
  Followed "Ethereum" (3/20)
Followed 3 topics
```

### Unfollowing Topics by Keyword

```js
const CONFIG = {
  action: 'unfollow',
  keywords: ['sports', 'football', 'basketball'],
  maxActions: 50,
  dryRun: true,
};
```

Navigate to `https://x.com/settings/your_topics` and run. The script finds topics matching your keywords and unfollows them.

### Unfollowing All Topics

For a clean slate:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  action: 'unfollowAll',
  maxActions: 200,       // Increase for many topics
  dryRun: true,
};
```

Navigate to `https://x.com/settings/your_topics` and run. The script unfollows every topic it finds.

### Discovering New Topics

```js
const CONFIG = {
  action: 'discover',
  maxActions: 50,
  dryRun: false,    // Safe -- only reads data
};
```

Navigate to `https://x.com/i/topics/picker/home` and run:

```
Discovering suggested topics...
  Technology
  Artificial Intelligence (following)
  Web3
  Cryptocurrency (following)
  Space Exploration
Discovered 5 topics
```

### Runtime Controls

```js
// Check progress
window.XActions.status();
// Output: Followed: 5 | Unfollowed: 0 | Listed: 0 | 23s

// Stop the script
window.XActions.abort();
```

## Tips & Tricks

- **Topics shape your For You feed.** Following the right topics tells X's algorithm what you want to see.
- **`list` and `discover` are read-only.** They are safe to run with `dryRun: false`.
- **Keywords are case-insensitive.** `'ai'` matches "AI", "Artificial Intelligence", etc.
- **Empty keywords means all.** For `follow`, empty keywords matches all available topics. For `unfollow`, it matches all followed topics.
- **Use `unfollowAll` for a fresh start.** Then selectively re-follow only topics relevant to your niche.
- **Increase `actionDelay` for safety.** X may rate-limit rapid follow/unfollow actions. 2500-3000ms is a safe interval.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Unknown action" | Valid actions: `list`, `follow`, `unfollow`, `unfollowAll`, `discover` |
| No topics found | Make sure you are on the correct page. `list`/`unfollow` needs `settings/your_topics`, `follow`/`discover` needs `i/topics` |
| Script navigates away | If you are not on a topics page, the script redirects. Run it again after the page loads |
| Follow buttons not found | X may have updated the UI. Check that topic cards are visible on the page |
| Unfollowed count is 0 | Your keywords may not match any followed topics. Try broader keywords or use `unfollowAll` |
