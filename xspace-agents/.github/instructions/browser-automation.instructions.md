# Browser Automation (packages/core/src/browser/)

## Self-Healing Selectors

The `SelectorEngine` in `selector-engine.ts` tries multiple strategies in order:
1. CSS selector
2. Text content match
3. ARIA attribute match

Selector definitions live in `selectors.ts` (`SELECTOR_DEFINITIONS`).

## Rules

- **Never hardcode CSS selectors** — always add them to `SELECTOR_DEFINITIONS` with multiple fallback strategies
- When X's DOM changes break a selector, add new alternatives rather than replacing old ones
- The admin panel can override selectors at runtime via `POST /admin/selectors/:name`
- Use `DOMObserver` (CDP-based) for watching DOM changes, not polling
