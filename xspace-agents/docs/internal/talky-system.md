# Talky Show System (NOT for standalone repo)

This documents the parts you want to **exclude** from the standalone repo.

---

## What It Is

An "AI comedy show" where 5 AI characters roast each other in a retro terminal web interface. Features:
- Auto-conversation: AIs talk to each other every 10 seconds
- User chat: visitors can send messages that AIs respond to
- Live Solana token data: market cap, trades, pump.fun chat
- Twitter reply monitoring
- ElevenLabs TTS for distinct character voices

---

## Server Code (server.js lines 547-943)

### AI Cast (line 575-581)
5 characters: Grok, GPT, Deepseek, Claude, Gemini
Each has: name, model (all use gpt-4o-mini), logo path, ASCII face, ElevenLabs voiceId

### /talky Namespace (line 598-658)
- On connection: sends cast, history, chat history
- Sends config flags (LIVE_TRADE, LIVE_CHAT, LIVE_MC)
- Handles `userChatMessage` with rate limiting (SPAM_SECONDS, default 30s)
- Spam keyword filter
- HTML sanitization

### processTalkyEvent() (line 660-791)
Two modes:
1. **Chat message response**: Random cast member replies to user. Prompt includes market data, conversation history, personality instructions. 45 token max.
2. **Auto-conversation**: "Director" AI picks speaker and target. Speaker generates roast. Both use OpenRouter/OpenAI (talkyAI client).

### Audio Pipeline (line 793-845)
- `getTalkyMP3Duration()` — Parse MP3 frame headers to estimate duration
- `sendTalkyAudio()` — ElevenLabs TTS via VOICE_API_KEY, broadcasts audio + dialogue

### Event System (line 847-883)
- Event queue with priority (chat messages processed first)
- 10-second idle countdown triggers auto-conversation
- Countdown broadcast to frontend for display

### Data Services (line 885-929)
- Birdeye: WebSocket price feed → `priceUpdate` events
- PumpPortal: WebSocket trade feed → `newTrade` events
- Pump.fun Chat: WebSocket chat → `newMessage` events + triggers AI conversation
- Twitter: Apify scraper → `newMessage` events + triggers AI conversation
