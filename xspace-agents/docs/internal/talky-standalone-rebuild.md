# Prompt: Talky Show — Standalone Rebuild

## Context
The Talky show was an AI comedy show where 5 AI characters (Grok, GPT, Deepseek, Claude, Gemini) roast each other in a retro CRT terminal web interface. It was previously embedded in the same monolith as the X Space agent. This prompt defines rebuilding it as a standalone project.

## What Talky Does
- 5 AI characters auto-converse every 10 seconds
- A "Director" AI picks who speaks and who they target
- Users can send chat messages that characters respond to
- Each character has a distinct ElevenLabs voice
- Optional integrations: pump.fun live chat, Solana token trades, Twitter reply monitoring
- Retro MS-DOS terminal aesthetic with ASCII character faces

## Key Design Decisions

### Character System
- Characters defined in `characters.json` so users can customize without touching code
- Each character has: name, model, personality prompt, ASCII art, ElevenLabs voiceId, accent color
- Adding a new character = adding a JSON entry (no code changes)

### Conversation Engine
- Event-driven queue with priority (user messages > external feeds > auto-conversation)
- Configurable idle timer (default 10s) before auto-conversation triggers
- Rate limiting per user (SPAM_SECONDS)
- HTML sanitization on all user input

### Integration System
- Each integration is a self-contained module that emits events
- Enabled/disabled via env vars (LIVE_CHAT, LIVE_TRADE, TWEET_CHECK, etc.)
- Server subscribes to integration events and feeds them into conversation engine
- Integrations auto-reconnect on disconnect

## Environment Variables

# Server

## Improvements Over Original
1. **Modular architecture** — no 900-line monolith
2. **Configurable characters** — JSON-based, not hardcoded
3. **Clean integration system** — each data source is a pluggable module
4. **Better error handling** — integrations fail independently, don't crash the show
5. **Proper event system** — Node EventEmitter with typed events

## Build Steps
1. Set up project skeleton (package.json, server.js, routes)
2. Port character definitions to characters.json
3. Build conversation engine (extract from original server.js lines 660-883)
4. Build TTS module (extract from original server.js lines 793-845)
5. Port each integration as standalone module
6. Port frontend (talky.html/js/css → clean single-page app)
7. Add .env.example and README

## Validation
- [ ] `npm start` launches server, serves frontend
- [ ] Characters auto-converse every 10 seconds
- [ ] User chat triggers character response
- [ ] Each character has distinct TTS voice
- [ ] Integrations can be toggled on/off without errors
- [ ] Adding a new character via JSON works without code changes
