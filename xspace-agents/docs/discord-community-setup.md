# Discord Community Setup Guide

This document covers exactly how to create and configure the Discord server for both **X Space Agent** and **agent-voice-chat**. Once set up, replace all `YOUR_SERVER_ID` and `YOUR_INVITE_CODE` placeholders in the READMEs with the real values.

2. Choose **For a club or community**
3. Name it: `X Space Agent & Voice Chat`
4. Upload the logo from `public/images/logo.svg` as the server icon

## 3. Roles

Create the following roles under **Server Settings → Roles**:

| Role | Color | Description | How to get it |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `@maintainer` | `#e74c3c` (red) | Core team / repo owners | Assigned manually by admins |
| `@contributor` | `#f39c12` (orange) | Has merged a PR to either repo | Assigned manually after PR merge |
| `@xspace-user` | `#3498db` (blue) | Uses xspace-agent SDK | Self-assign via reaction roles (see §5) |
| `@voice-chat-user` | `#9b59b6` (purple) | Uses agent-voice-chat | Self-assign via reaction roles (see §5) |

**Role permissions:**
- `@maintainer` — Admin permissions
- `@contributor` — Can post in `#contributing`
- `@xspace-user` / `@voice-chat-user` — Standard member permissions

Make `#releases` **send-messages** permission to `@everyone: Deny` so only bots can post there.

## 4. Bots

### GitHub Bot (Automatic Release Announcements)

1. Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**
2. Use the Discord Server's webhook URL (from `#releases` → Edit Channel → Integrations → Create Webhook)
3. Set Payload URL to: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN/github`
4. Content type: `application/json`
5. Select **individual events** → check only **Releases**
6. Save

Alternatively, use the official [GitHub Discord App](https://discord.com/application-directory/discord-github) (slash commands in any channel).

### Welcome Bot (MEE6 or Carl-bot)

**Option A — MEE6 (recommended):**
1. Add MEE6 at [mee6.xyz](https://mee6.xyz)
2. Go to MEE6 Dashboard → your server → **Welcome**
3. Enable welcome messages → set channel to `#welcome`
4. Set the welcome message (see §5 below for the template)

**Option B — Carl-bot:**
1. Add Carl-bot at [carl.gg](https://carl.gg)
2. Go to Dashboard → **Welcome & Leave** → Welcome
3. Set channel to `#welcome`, paste the welcome template

### Reaction Roles (Carl-bot or MEE6)

Post a message in `#welcome` like:

```
React to get a role:
🤖 → @xspace-user
🎙️ → @voice-chat-user
```

Then set up reaction roles in your bot dashboard mapping those emoji to the roles.
