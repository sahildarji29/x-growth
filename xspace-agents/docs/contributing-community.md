# Prompt: Contributing Guide & Community Infrastructure

## Why
Open-source projects don't grow from code alone — they grow from contributors. A great CONTRIBUTING.md is the difference between "I want to help but don't know how" and someone's first PR.

## Files to Create

### CONTRIBUTING.md
```markdown
# Contributing to X Space Agent

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xspace-agent`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
5. Make your changes
6. Run tests: `pnpm test`
7. Run type check: `pnpm typecheck`
8. Commit: `git commit -m "feat: add cool thing"`
9. Push: `git push origin my-feature`
10. Open a PR

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 8+
- Chromium (for E2E tests)

### Install
\```bash
pnpm install
\```

### Run in dev mode
\```bash
pnpm dev          # starts server with hot reload
\```

### Run tests
\```bash
pnpm test         # all tests
pnpm test:watch   # watch mode
pnpm test:coverage # with coverage
\```

### Build
\```bash
pnpm build        # compile TypeScript
pnpm typecheck    # type check without emitting
pnpm lint         # lint all files
\```

## Project Structure

\```
packages/
  core/     ← SDK library (most contributions go here)
  cli/      ← Command-line tool
  server/   ← Admin panel + API server
examples/   ← Example projects
docs/       ← Documentation site (VitePress)
\```

## What to Contribute

### Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled `good first issue`. These are specifically selected for new contributors.

### Areas We Need Help
- **New AI providers** — add support for Mistral, Cohere, Together, etc.
- **New TTS providers** — add support for Cartesia, PlayHT, LMNT, etc.
- **Examples** — build example projects showing creative uses
- **Documentation** — fix typos, improve guides, add screenshots
- **Bug fixes** — check open issues
- **Tests** — increase coverage, especially in audio pipeline

### Adding a New Provider
This is the easiest way to make a meaningful contribution:

1. Create `packages/core/src/providers/your-provider.ts`
2. Implement the `LLMProvider` interface:
\```typescript
import { LLMProvider, Message } from '../types'

export class YourProvider implements LLMProvider {
  readonly type = 'socket'
  readonly name = 'your-provider'

  async generateResponse({ messages, systemPrompt }) {
    // Call your API
    return responseText
  }
}
\```
3. Register in `packages/core/src/providers/index.ts`
4. Add tests in `packages/core/tests/unit/providers/`
5. Add to docs: `docs/guide/providers.md`
6. Submit PR!

## Commit Convention
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `test:` — adding tests
- `refactor:` — code change that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature
- `chore:` — maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)

Examples:
- `feat: add Mistral provider`
- `fix: handle empty STT response`
- `docs: add authentication screenshots`

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template
2. Ensure CI passes (lint + typecheck + tests)
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update docs if you changed the public API
5. One approval required for merge

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- No `any` in public APIs
- Meaningful variable names
- Comments only for non-obvious logic
- Export types from `types.ts`, not individual files

## Need Help?
- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/org/xspace-agent/discussions)
